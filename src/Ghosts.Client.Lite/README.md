# GHOSTS LITE

## Background

### What is this?
GHOSTS LITE is a streamlined version of the GHOSTS framework designed to simulate realistic 
network without the expense of running actual applications. It generates web browsing traffic 
and file creation programatically and is configured to be similar to real-user actions. 

### Why did we build this? 
We built ghosts-lite to provide a more efficient tool for simulating network activity. By 
avoiding the need to launch applications like web browsers or office suites, ghosts-lite is 
able to reduce the resource consumption and complexity of the simulation, resulting in saving 
CPU, storage space, and other memory resources.

### What were the goals?

- **Efficiency:** Reduce the resources required to simualte user activity on a network.
- **Simplicity:** Simplify installation and configuration compared to the full GHOSTS framework
- **Realism:** Maintain the ability to generate realistic network activity.
